  ## *Installation*

  To install app, download from my repository. Then npm install all dependencies linked in the package.json.(check package versions on npm site to make sure all are up to date.)

  ## Usage 

  Once installed use "npm run seed" to seed database, and use npm start to begin the server. If server doesnt connect you, you should create a .env file and add the password, username associations found in the config folders script file. Link your sql username, password, and the database name found in the db/schema file. Then you should be ready to test app functionality in Insomnia.
